# SecureAuth – A Secure Authentication System

SecureAuth is a modern, robust authentication system built with React, Redux, Firebase, and JWT. It provides a complete solution for secure user authentication and session management, ensuring that your web application’s protected resources are accessible only by authorized users.



## Key Features

### JWT-Based Authentication
- Utilizes JSON Web Tokens to securely authenticate users and manage sessions.

### Firebase Integration
- Leverages Firebase for backend support including authentication, storage, and real-time database functionalities.

### Protected Routes
- Implements secure route handling so that only authenticated users can access specific parts of your application.

### User Management
- Includes functionalities for user sign-up, sign-in, profile updates, and sign-out.

### Modern React Stack
- Built using React functional components with hooks, along with Redux for state management, ensuring scalable and maintainable code.

### Tailwind CSS Styling
- Provides a clean, responsive, and modern UI powered by Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imkrishmkkk/secure-authentication-system.git
cd secure-auth
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory any other required environment variables (e.g., JWT secret, API endpoints) and in client directory  to add your Firebase configuration .

### Run the Application Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

SecureAuth demonstrates a complete secure authentication flow:

### Sign Up / Sign In
- Users can create an account or log in securely. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued to manage sessions.

### Protected Routes
- Routes that require authentication are guarded, redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.

### Profile Management
- Users can update their profiles (including uploading profile images to Firebase Storage) and view secure content on the Home page.
